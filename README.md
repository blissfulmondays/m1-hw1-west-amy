## About Me
I am a professional photographer in Oregon who specializes in photographing newborns, babies and families. I am a former US Navy Mass Communication Specialist and Photographer's Mate. I have 4 children, one currently in the US Navy.  
## Past Coding Experience
I have very little past coding experience. I remember as a child having to type in code to create games on our Commodore 64. I had so much fun creating these games, but the code writing was so tedious, and I was so prone to making mistakes and having to start over. Since the, I have used code sparingly to make tiny modifications on premade designs for the websites I have created. I didn't know what I was doing but was able to "Google" instructions to figure out how to make the modifications I needed. 
## Career Goals  
I would love to work as a remote marketer, product and web designer. I am hoping with my skills I can obtain a job that allows me to be present for my kids, provide medical insurance for them and fulfill my desire to use work in a field that brings me a sense of accomplishment and joy.
